# Bridge-card-Dealing-Program
This repository stores the source codes of a virtual bridge card dealing program which I worked on 3 years ago. 
The program was utilized to generate statistical results regarding certain openings and auctions in different bidding systems, namely 2/1, Twalsh, precision and Symmetrical Relay (SR)

In case you don't know, bridge is an amazing card game! It is the most fascinating mind sport I have ever played in my life (I only know bridge tho lmao).
